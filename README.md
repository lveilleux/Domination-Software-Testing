# Domination-Software-Testing  
Repository for SWEN 352 Software Testing  
  
This repository holds the Domination project for RIT's SWEN-352 Software Testing course. The goal of this project was to develop tests
for the original Domination project as the course progressed. This included unit, integration, and UI tests. Additional testing was done manually,
which is not shown in this repository.
